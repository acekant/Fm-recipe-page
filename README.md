## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

In this challenge i learned that how to change color of list bullets

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
marker:text-Rose_800 (in tailwind)
or
ul {
  marker:hsl(14, 45%, 36%)
} (in CSS)
```

### Continued development

I would like to gain more experience in margin and padding like in sometimes they don't work for some element like table, span etc
I would also like to gain more knowledge in tailwind like animation

My future plant to enrich my skills are that make more and more project on css like from easy to complex with animations and other advance stuffs. I would like make clone like tesla, spotify and for animation website i would like to use figma template from figma.com
